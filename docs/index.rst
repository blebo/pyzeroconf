Python Zeroconf (mDNS) Library (pyzeroconf)
===========================================

Pyzeroconf provides a simple mDNS implementation.  It provides:

 * mDNS service discovery (mdns-sd, finding network services by type)
 * mDNS host-name negotiation (servername.local)
 * a multicast socket abstraction for generic multicast support

Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python, v0.12
Copyright (C) 2003, Paul Scott-Murphy

    This module provides a framework for the use of DNS Service Discovery
    using IP multicast.  It has been tested against the JMDNS
    implementation from `StrangeBerry <http://jmdns.sourceforge.net>`_,
    and against the mDNSResponder from Mac OS X 10.3.8.
